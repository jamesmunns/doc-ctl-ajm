# James' projects

## What is this

This is a listing of all of my personal projects. See the [doc-ctl] repo for how this works

## Project ID Allocations

Note: I'm starting at `00100`, because I have older projects that existed before I came up with this doc control idea, and I might go back some day and reindex that.
